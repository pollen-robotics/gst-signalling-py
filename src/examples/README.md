# Gstreamer signaling with aiortc examples

## Examples

You can find different examples related to gstreamer signaling in this folder.
In particular, you can find examples for:

* [retrieving the list of producers](./get_producer_list.py)
* [peer status listener](./listener.py)
* [data producer and multiple consumer](./datachannel-single-producer-multiple-consumer/)


## Aiortc examples
Some of the examples are directly taken from the great [aiortc project](https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc) to make sure that our gstreamer signaling is as compatible with the aiortc library as possible.

You can have a look at:

* [datachannel-cli](./datachannel-cli/)
* [videostream-cli](./videostream-cli/)

Those are good entry points if you are already using aiortc and want to switch to gstreamer signaling.
